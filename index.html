				<h2>What's the problem with private messages?</h2>
        <p>Nothing is wrong with private messages when the messages need to be private. Messages that are truly private should remain private. Messages that are personal in nature, contains company secrets, or involves customers, or any other communication that requires discretion, then of course use a private means of communication.</p>

                <h2>Which messages should not be private?</h2>
                <p>
                    Answer: messages that can serve a wider audience. Too much knowledge is lost in private messages. Questions and answers that could help someone else at a later time are undiscoverable to a wider audience due to the nature of private messages.

                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>Over the years, I've seen too much quality Q&A be lost due to private interactions. 1:1 emails, Slack messages, LinkedIn messages, Twitter DM, and Team chats have been used to send private messages. These private messages were filled with quality information that would never be indexed and discoverable by anyone else. I encourage us all to ask ourselves whether we need to send our questions directly to another person, or can we post our message in way that is discoverable by other people. </p>
                <p>Consider whether you can send your message to a Team or Slack channel, a GitHub issue, a StackOverflow post, Microsoft Q&A, or whereever the appropriate audience may find the Q&A. Try to default to the widest distribution channel.

        <h2>Acknowledgment of the vulnerability</h2>
        <p>Asking questions in the open can make us feel vulnerable. This sensation is experienced by nearly all of us. Know you are not alone with that feeling. New people on the team, you should do what you are most comfortable with in terms of communication.</p>
